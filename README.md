# SafeVault

<h2><b>Project Overview  </b></h2>
SafeVault is a password management software using MySQL for secure storage of online credentials, combined with an intuitive, customizable GUI built using Pythonâ€™s CustomTkinter, provides enhanced security and user control. This approach ensures data remains protected locally while offering a modern, user-friendly interface for seamless password management.
	
Storing credentials locally on a user's own system, rather than on external cloud servers, significantly reduces the risk of breaches associated with online password managers. With this offline solution, the password database is stored in a MySQL database on the user's device, keeping sensitive information protected from online hacking attempts or server-side vulnerabilities.
	
Since the data is not stored on a remote server, there's no need to worry about data being compromised through cloud service provider breaches or third-party access. Users can manage their credentials in a way that aligns with their own security practices, such as frequent encryption and backups of the local database.
